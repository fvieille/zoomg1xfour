# zoomg1xfour

Zoom g1four controler:

Project is to build a pedalboard controler for Zoom G1xfour for use in live conditions

Goal is to have footswitchs able to reproduce channel selector of an amp, clean/overdrive or Normal/boost switch with one button.

ie footswitch to select from off= "Clean channel" Patch / on="Overdrive channel" Patch
or footswitch to select from off= "Overdrive channel" Patch" / on="Boosted Overdrive channel" Patch

using a latched switch, controler will be able to detect at off position if patch is "Clean channel" or "Overdrive channel" on the zoom
making it possible to engage repectively "Overdrive channel" or Boosted Overdrive channel".
So ,before song "Clean" or "Overdrive" will be selected form the Zoom footswitch, during the song, patch changes will be selected from the controler footswich. 
 
 
- First with an old Raspberry Pi 1b model, further with Arduino or raspberry pico microcontroler.
